# Notification module

For the error detection, it is required to create a module, which is able to 
send notifications over ROS topics. In the previous section, the following notification messages were still introduced: 
 - Warning
 - Info
 - Error
 - Debug
 - Danger
 
The created ROS module is accessible in Github and also the whole documentation of this module 
can be read in the [README file on Github](https://github.com/CapChrisCap/roboy_system_notification).
